# stability

This directory contains [KeYmaera X](http://keymaeraX.org/) stability proofs for several example systems:

- `ODE` contains ODE stability proofs (Examples from TACAS'21, Section 5)

- `switchedsystems` contains stability proofs for several switched systems stabilized using different switching approaches (Examples from ADHS'21, Section 5). The directory `switched_systems` contains more stability proofs for switched systems.

- `UGpAS` contains switched system stability case studies and proofs using the notion of uniform global asymptotic stability (Examples from HSCC'22, Section 5).

See the respective `.kyx` files for further details.

# stability

This directory contains [KeYmaera X](http://keymaeraX.org/) stability proofs for several example systems:

- `pendulum` and `pendulumexp` prove asymptotic stability and global exponential stability for a (linearized) pendulum ODE. Similarly, `invpendulum` proves asymptotic stability for a linearized inverted pendulum with PD control.

- `rigidbody` and `frictionalrigidbody` prove stability properties for rotations of 3D rigid bodies.

- `mooregreitzer` proves epsilon-stability for a simple jet engine model.

- `switchedsystems` proves stability for several switched systems stabilized using different switching approaches.

See the respective `.kyx` files for further details.

Simple examples of differential ghosts.

See [Nathan's blog post](http://nfulton.org/2017/01/14/Ghosts/).

Note: All of these proofs can be done automatically using the `ODE` tactic.

 * `example_1.kya` is Example 1 in the blog post (ghosts for open sets)
 * `example_2.kya` is Example 2 in the blog post (ghosts for open sets)
 * `example_3.kya` is the Equilibrium point proof from the blog post. I just
   use `ODE` for the portions of the proof that are covered in previous examples.
 * `example_4.kya` is the >= example from the blog post. Again, I just use
   `ODE` for the potions of the proof that are covered in previous examples.

European Train Control System ETCS
==================================

Complex physical systems have several degrees of freedom. They only work correctly when their control parameters obey 
corresponding constraints. Based on the informal specification of the European Train Control System (ETCS), we design 
a controller for its cooperation protocol. For its free parameters, we successively identify constraints that are 
required to ensure collision freedom. We formally prove the parameter constraints to be sharp by characterizing them 
equivalently in terms of reachability properties of the hybrid system dynamics. We formally verify controllability, 
safety, and reactivity properties of the ETCS protocol that entail collision freedom.

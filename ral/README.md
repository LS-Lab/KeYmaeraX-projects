Robot Waypoint Navigation
=========================

Models and proofs on robot waypoint navigation. We present a reusable formally verified safety net 
that provides end-to-end safety and liveness guarantees for 2D waypoint-following of 
Dubins-type ground robots with tolerances and acceleration. We: 
* Model a robot in differential dynamic logic (dL), and specify assumptions on the controller and robot kinematics, and
* Prove formal safety and liveness properties for waypoint-following with speed limits.
The guarantees for the safety net apply to any robot as long as the waypoints are chosen safely and the physical assumptions 
in its model hold.

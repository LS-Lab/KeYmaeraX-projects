Curved Flight Collision Avoidance Maneuvers
===========================================

Aircraft collision avoidance maneuvers are important and complex applications. Curved flight exhibits nontrivial continuous 
behavior. In combination with the control choices during air traffic maneuvers, this yields hybrid systems with challenging 
interactions of discrete and continuous dynamics. We analyze collision freedom of roundabout maneuvers in air traffic control, 
where appropriate curved flight, good timing, and compatible maneuvering are crucial for guaranteeing safe spatial separation 
of aircraft throughout their flight. We show that formal verification of hybrid systems can scale to curved flight maneuvers 
required in aircraft control applications. We introduce a fully flyable variant of the roundabout collision avoidance maneuver 
and verify safety properties by compositional verification.

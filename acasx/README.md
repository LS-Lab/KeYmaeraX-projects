Next-generation Airborn Collision Avoidance ACAS X
==================================================

The Next-Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS X) is intended to be installed on all large aircraft 
to give advice to pilots and prevent mid-air collisions with other aircraft. It is currently being developed by the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In this paper we determine the geometric configurations under which the 
advice given by ACAS X is safe under a precise set of assumptions and formally verify these configurations using 
hybrid systems theorem proving techniques. We consider subsequent advisories and show how to adapt our formal 
verification to take them into account. We examine the current version of the real ACAS X system and discuss 
some cases where our safety theorem conflicts with the actual advisory given by that version, demonstrating how 
formal hybrid systems proving approaches are helping to ensure the safety of ACAS X. Our approach is general and 
could also be used to identify unsafe advice issued by other collision avoidance systems or confirm their safety.
